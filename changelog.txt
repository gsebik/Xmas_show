 - wav memory allocation now dynamically done with mmap (was 480 MB RAM
 allocated, which was almost out of bounds and broke the program)

 - mlock for audio, so no demand paging (a.k.a. lazy loading), whole .wav is
 loaded into the RAM, avoiding flash page faults. Added optional
 mlockall, so all of the code and data can be loaded into the RAM.

 - replaced fprintf() logging with syslog. Will need a proper logging thread.
